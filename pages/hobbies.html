        <h1>Kendo</h1>
    </body> I have been practicing Kendo for about nine years. It's a kind of japanese martial arts with a bamboo sword. My club is located in Basel. In Kendo, you can pass different grades, 6-1 Kyu and then 1-8 Dan. I'm currently 1. Dan and was supposed to do my 2. in October, but now I can't, because my ankle is broken. 
I also practice with the Swiss national team and am hoping to go to the european championshis next year, though it might also be difficult because I'm going to miss practice. I also really like hanging out with the people from my club and other clubs.
    <h1>Harp</h1>
    </body> I have played the harp for the last ten years. I'm also in a group with another harpenist and a flutist. I mainly play folk or classical music, but sometimes I also play movie soundtracks, pop, or rock. When I was in primary school, I played the harp in the orchestra.
    <h1>Singing</h1>
</body> I've had singing lessons for three years, it's really enjoyable because we do a variety of genres and I also get to choose songs sometimes. I just got a new teacher a few weeks ago. I also sing in the school choir, currently as an alto 2, but I can also sing the soprano 1, I'm just better at singing in a deep voice.
<h1>Horseback Riding</h1>
</body> I used to have lessons when I was a child, I then stopped at some point because my teacher did'nt continue teaching. When I was twelve, I got lessons on a different farm as a gift for my birthday. Since then, I go there every saturday.
